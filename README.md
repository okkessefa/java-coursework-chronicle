"# java-coursework-chronicle" 
# Computer Engineering – Java Code Archive

This repository collects the Java programs, exercises, and mini-projects that I write during my Computer Engineering degree.

The structure follows my **official curriculum**: code is organised by **year**, **semester**, and **course name** (for example, `ComputerProgrammingI`, `DataStructures`, `OperatingSystems`). Many folders will grow over time as I progress through each semester.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Track my development as a Java programmer over all four years.
- Map real university courses (Computer Programming I, Data Structures, Operating Systems, etc.) to concrete code examples.
- Provide a clean, commented reference for future revision and interview preparation.
- Build a portfolio that reflects:
  - Fundamental programming competence
  - Object-oriented design skills
  - Data structures and algorithmic thinking
  - The progression of my Computer Engineering education

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository continues to be organized hierarchically with each update:

- **Year** → `year1`, `year2`, `year3`, `year4`
- **Semester** → `semester1`, `semester2`, …, `semester8`
- **Course** → folders named after lecture titles (e.g. `ComputerProgrammingI`, `DataStructures`)
